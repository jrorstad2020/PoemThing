the water was clear like a clear thing
when someone calls my phone goes ring ring
I pick it up like trash on the ground
and to my surprise I hear a great sound
to my surprise silence pierces the air
This calls for a break so I sit on a lawn-chair
And yet I live in a lawnless land
I high five my opponents face with my massive hand
